# Swahili Auto Correct App

Swahili Auto Correct is a simple Tkinter-based application designed to provide auto-correction and word suggestions for Swahili text input.

## Features

### Auto-Correction

The application automatically corrects Swahili sentences by identifying and suggesting corrections for misspelled words. It uses a Swahili dictionary to compare and correct user input.

### Word Suggestions

The app offers word suggestions based on the user's input. It employs two search algorithms to find relevant suggestions:

1. **Main Dictionary Search:**
   - The application searches for suggestions in the main Swahili dictionary.
   - It suggests words that match the input, helping users choose the correct spelling.

2. **Conjugations Search:**
   - The app also considers words with conjugations.
   - It provides suggestions from words that include conjugations, enhancing the user's vocabulary.

## Search Algorithms

### Main Dictionary Search

The main dictionary search algorithm is based on exact string matching. It compares the user's input to words in the Swahili dictionary and suggests matches.

### Conjugations Search

For words with conjugations, the app uses a similar string matching algorithm to suggest words that include conjugations. This enhances the app's ability to recognize and correct conjugated forms of verbs.
